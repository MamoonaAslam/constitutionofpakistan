### By Mamoona Aslam
<p><div class="text-blue mb-2">We are living in 21 century, where only that person have right to do anything who has an evil power. Freedom of speech means the right to show our opinion and give suggestions without government restraint is a democratic ideal that dates back to ancient Greece
Freedom of speech and the right to freedom of expression applies to ideas of all kinds including those that may be deeply offensive. But it comes with responsibilities and we believe it can be legitimately restricted.You might not expect us to say this, but in certain circumstances free speech and freedom of expression can be restricted.
Governments have an obligation to prohibit hate speech and incitement. And restrictions can also be justified if they protect specific public interest or the rights and reputations of others.
Any restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of expression must be set out in laws that must in turn be clear and concise so everyone can understand them.
People imposing the restrictions (whether they are governments, employers or anyone else) must be able to demonstrate the need for them, and they must be proportionate.
All of this has to be backed up by safeguards to stop the abuse of these restrictions and incorporate a proper appeals process. And where it can't happen Restrictions that do not comply with all these conditions violate freedom of expression.
We consider people put in prison solely for exercising their right to free speech to be prisoners of conscience. 
Jabbar Savalan was imprisoned after calling for protests against the government on Facebook. We considered him a prisoner of conscience and campaigned for his release. Under the Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of the Press, subject to any ‘reasonable restriction’, imposed by law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, or in relation to contempt of court or incitement to offence.
Today, media freedom is practically, 'mute', on TV under so called, “self-censorship”, which in reality is, censorship. With the Election-2018 round the corner, the media likes to get both, ‘carrot and stick’, and there may be a ‘silence period’ for the media in election as once happened during 2008.
Just for the record, let me reproduce the notification of Pemra issued on February 16, 2008 with a title, ‘Election-2008 Political Campaign - Media Silence Period’, which says ‘footage or reporting of any political activity, event, personality, candidate or their online comments, interviews shall also be banned in news from 000 hours on electronic media’. This notification was later withdrawn after a strong protest from the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ).
What we are witnessing today, is a different kind of curbs on the media. It is called self-censorship but in reality it is censorship as this mechanism comes under instructions. True, freedom comes with responsibility, but, today, we are neither free nor responsible.So the Article 19 requires a serious review and amendments to protect citizens' freedom of speech and expression as well as the freedom of the Press. There is a need for a forum which could address issues and complaints of either party in case of violation. In case of any action, it should be under the existing laws.
Democracy cannot survive without freedom of speech and expression. Freedom of expression, being a natural fundamental right, could not be suppressed unless the same was being exploited. The law specifically states that Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan confers on all citizens the right of freedom of speech by providing that every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan.
The recent unlawful actions against the social media users by the law enforcing agencies clearly lacks the elements of reasonableness and is contrary to the constitution of Pakistan in terms of Article 19. It certainly amounts to a gross abuse of power that must be brought to an end with a clear and categorical commitment by the government that the actions will not be repeated.
It is important to understand that the public office is a public agency and a trust created in the interest and for the benefit of the people of Pakistan and since an incumbent of a public office is invested with certain powers and charged with certain duties pertinent to sovereignty, the powers so delegated to the officers are held in trust for the citizens of Pakistan.</p>
Such trust extends to all matters within the range of the duties pertaining to the office. A public officer is amenable to the rule, which forbids an agent or trustee to place himself in such an attitude. After all, public officers are nothing but the servants of the citizens of Pakistan.
